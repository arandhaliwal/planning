Notes:

problem with knn: new case can be exactly same as an old case but have a different outcome
unbalanced dataset means that irrelevant cases can be deemed among most relevant
knn is only working with approval cases, pretty much. refused successes very rare.

Tests on regular outcomes not very useful due to imbalance of db

Natural error due to fact that this isnt complete info - only proposal/constraints

Tests:




AACBR, reg outcomes:


Normal test on whole casebase each time: 80% accuracy - but worse than 88% rate if you chose all approved (zero rule) as 264/300 approvals. (better than random at 50%? unsure)
P = 264
N = 36
True positives: 229
False positives = 25
True negatives = 11
False negatives = 35

Precision (PPV) = 0.901
NPV = 0.293
Recall (TPR) = 0.867
TNR = 0.305

F1 = 0.884

Temporally ordered test: 70 fails out of 300 - 77% accuracy
P = 264
N = 36
TP = 222
FP = 28
TN = 8
FN = 42

Precision (PPV) = 0.888
NPV = 0.16
Recall (TPR) = 0.841
TNR = 0.222

F1 = 0.817

> Slightly better results with whole cb available - implies better with more information

Not useful to look at local accuracy because of imbalanced casebase and lots of approvals at start? (areas with many approvals tend to have higher success rate)
Local success rates (each 50 tests)
1. 88%
2. 78%
3. 68%
4. 76%
5. 82%
6. 68%
-> no improvement, seemingly random / determined by location of approvals due to imbalanced dataset.





AACBR with factors as outcomes:


Test with whole casebase (300 cases):

Accuracy = 81% - compared to a best case of 57% using zero rule on negatives - huge improvement

P = 127
N = 168
TP = 82
FP = 11
TN = 157
FN = 45

Precision (PPV) = 0.882
NPV = 0.777
Recall (TPR) = 0.646
TNR = 0.935

F1 = 0.746


Test with temporal ordering, using only previous cases each time:

Accuracy = 81%

P = 127
N = 168
TP = 81
FP = 10
TN = 158
FN = 46

Precision (PPV) = 0.890
NPV = 0.775
Recall (TPR) = 0.638
TNR = 0.940

F1 = 0.743

Very little difference between using whole casebase and only using previous cases each time

Local accuracy rates (measured for every 59 out of 295 cases):
1. 78%
2. 78%
3. 73%
4. 84%
5. 76%

No clear pattern as before, possible that positions of cases affects this
