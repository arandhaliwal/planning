problem with knn: new case can be exactly same as an old case but have a different outcome
unbalanced dataset means that irrelevant cases can be deemed among most relevant
knn is only working with approval cases, pretty much. refused successes very rare.

Tests

Note: Tests on regular outcomes not very useful due to imbalance of db

Regular case (AACBR, reg outcomes):

Flat test on whole casebase each time: 60 fails out of 300 - 80% accuracy - but worse than 88% rate if you chose all approved (zero rule) as 264/300 approvals. (better than random at 50%? unsure)
P = 264
N = 36
True positives: 229
False positives = 25
True negatives = 11
False negatives = 35

Precision (PPV) = 0.901
NPV = 0.293
Recall (TPR) = 0.867
TNR = 0.305

F1 = 0.884

Temporally ordered test: 70 fails out of 300 - 77% success rate. 
P = 264
N = 36

F1 = 

Not useful to look at local success rates because of imbalanced casebase and lots of approvals at start? (areas with many approvals tend to have higher success rate)
Local success rates (each 50 tests)
1. 88%
2. 78%
3. 68%
4. 76%
5. 82%
6. 68%
-> no improvement, seemingly random / determined by location of approvals due to imbalanced dataset.
