problem with knn: new case can be exactly same as an old case but have a different outcome
unbalanced dataset means that irrelevant cases can be deemed among most relevant
knn is only working with approval cases, pretty much. refused successes very rare.

Tests

Regular case (AACBR, reg outcomes):

Flat test on whole casebase each time: 68 fails out of 299 - 77% success rate - but worse than 89% rate if you chose all approved as 268/299 approvals. (better than random at 50%? unsure)
